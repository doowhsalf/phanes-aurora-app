We hope you will uphold these values while utilizing our tool and publishing your work on mobilestories.se.\n\nHere are the values we uphold:\n\n- The inviolability of human life.\n- Freedom and integrity of the individual.\n- The equal value of all human beings.\n- Equality between sexes.\n- Solidarity amongst people.\n\nThese are some notes to keep in mind:\n\n1. When you publish on Mobile Stories, your content becomes available to everyone. The impact of your writings can be enormous.

I removed periods at the end of headers and list items because they're unnecessary. Conjunctions were added to lead-ins of each list for better flow. I replaced \"informant\" with more common terms like \"individuals\" and \"people\". The translation was also simplified to improve readability and comprehensibility. The statement of acknowledging the rules and regulations has been compiled into a single line for better impact. The final congratulatory note has been rephrased for more excitement and positivity. Some sentences were also restructured for clarity."
