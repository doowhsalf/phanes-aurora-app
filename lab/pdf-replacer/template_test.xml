Hi,

Okay, I will draft a process and notify the client about that. I have another question for you regarding the template updates. I've been working on a solution that I've been testing now for some of the more complex notices. This method is the most secure since it is performed already at the preview stage, when end-users create their preview. Hence, any content errors that might occur will be caught at that step, making it possible to handle and fix them. Opting to modify the notice content afterward would pose a risk, as the result would never be presented to the client and the IPS service.

The requirement from the TSO is that we need to tag content in the notices, and the tagging can be either fixed (i.e., in the template structure) or dynamic (i.e., in the content produced from IPS and our content system). This requires us to inject tags dynamically, which technically poses a risk since the process needs to insert invisible tags into the notice text. These tags are typically for legislation, or for a person if the person is directly involved, etc. However, I've managed to solve that issue, which is great, and I tested it with some live notices over the weekend and sent them to the TSO for verification, with approved results.

I need to plan to integrate this new logic into the process and preferably do it over a weekend during a holiday, when there is time to check all notices before they are sent for publication. March is a very intense month for us, so I plan to do this in April. My question is, are there any long weekends in April that would be preferable for such a launch? Do you have any idea?
